This game is intended to be controlled using the keyboard.

## Synopsis

Kagerou Imaizumi, down with some identity crisis woes, hikes her way to Myouren Temple to seek the council of the head nun, Byakuren Hijiri. Instead, she runs into Murasa Minamitsu, a ship phantom who resides at the temple and studies under Byakuren. However, their conversation is cut short by a dazzling "sunset".

## Gameplay

2D platformer with a mix of puzzle and technical elements. A great mirror splits the stage into two identical parts, and you will be tasked with reaching the end of the stage in this bizarre mirrored form.
